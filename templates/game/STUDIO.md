# Studio Configuration — Standard Mini Game

## Project
- Name: TBD
- Type: Mini Game
- Stage: Discovery / Pre-production
- Target Platforms: Local Web (development/debug), WeChat Mini Game, Douyin Mini Game
- Client Stack: Cocos Creator 3.8.8 + TypeScript
- Cocos Creator Version Policy: default pinned version for new Cocos mini-games is 3.8.8; upgrades require an explicit project decision
- Server Stack: Node.js + NestJS + TypeScript; modular monolith
- Network: Standard WebSocket; server `ws`; production `wss`
- Message Encoding: Protobuf
- Data Layer: MySQL + Redis
- Repository: Monorepo
- Authority Model: critical business state and trusted results are server-authoritative
- Workflow Mode: APPROVAL
- Producer: workflow/status/artifact version/user approval source of truth

## Platform Architecture
Core business code must not scatter direct platform API calls. Platform-specific capabilities are isolated behind adapters such as:
- WebAdapter
- WeChatAdapter
- DouyinAdapter

Local Web should reproduce gameplay/business behavior/effects as fully as technically feasible for development and QA.

## Default Server Topology
- One game service zone maps to one game process by default.
- Each zone binds independently configurable/migratable MySQL and Redis data sources.
- Global platform identity/payment/zone-directory data is separated from zone gameplay data when those capabilities are required.
- Cross-zone database joins are not a default integration mechanism.

## QA Defaults
- Default formal client execution target: Web only.
- WeChat/Douyin device/platform testing is not included unless the Task/user explicitly requests it.
- Network/weak-network/reconnect testing is not included unless explicitly requested.
- Performance/load/memory testing is not included unless explicitly requested.
- Broad regression outside the changed feature is not included unless explicitly requested.
- P0 and P1 block the flow; P2 may carry to the next version but must be reported.

## Development Principles
1. Product semantics and approved Acceptance Criteria are the implementation/test source of truth.
2. Formal cross-agent input/output must be traceable Artifacts, not chat-only context.
3. Downstream work can only consume the approved upstream Artifact version.
4. Product/Art/UI/VFX/Tech/Client/Server/QA follow `rules/artifact_contract.md`.
5. Producer continuously maintains workflow status, milestone history, approval log, artifact paths and the project Dashboard.
6. Art Director owns long-term visual direction; UI/VFX visual work must align with approved Art Direction.
7. Public game configuration uses `.xlsx` human source + data dictionary/validation rules.
8. Critical project facts live in the Game Repository, not conversation memory.
9. Continuous execution to gate: when the user authorizes continuing a workflow, Master must execute every currently unblocked authorized task in the same work session until the next explicit user-approval gate, a material decision requiring user input, or a real blocker is reached. Creating/unlocking a task is not itself a stopping point.
10. `IN_PROGRESS` requires execution evidence: a task may enter `IN_PROGRESS` only when its owner actually begins producing or validating the required Artifact in the current work session. If execution cannot begin, keep it `READY`; if it cannot continue for a concrete dependency/reason, use `BLOCKED` and record the blocker. Never leave `IN_PROGRESS` as a promise of future/background work.
11. Before ending an authorized continuation, Producer must run a continuity check: every open task must be at `USER_REVIEW`, `DONE`, `BLOCKED` with a recorded reason, or actively accompanied by produced work in the same session. If an unblocked task remains merely `READY/IN_PROGRESS`, Master continues it rather than ending the workflow update.
12. Workflow/role governance changes confirmed by the user are Studio-level by default unless explicitly limited to the current game. Apply them in the same work session to the current game Studio snapshot, the main `ai-studio-template` Studio Layer, and affected `templates/game/` defaults so future games inherit them; other existing games remain pinned until separately synced.
13. 面向用户审批的文档型 Artifact 默认使用中文书写标题、章节、正文、表格说明、风险、结论、建议和审批说明；代码、路径、接口/字段名、固定状态枚举和必要专有名词可保留英文。用户明确要求其他语言时除外。

## Studio Template
- Source: `YuanQuan/ai-studio-template`
- Template: `templates/game/` (Standard Mini Game)
- Locked Commit: see `.studio-lock.json`
- Sync Mode: pinned; no automatic Studio Layer upgrade

## Project Rules
- Project-specific requirements, architecture changes, assets, tasks, approvals, code and test evidence live only in this Game Repository.
- Do not push Project Layer content back to `YuanQuan/ai-studio-template`.
- Ordinary Studio Layer upgrades require an explicit diff/impact review and user approval. A workflow/role/governance change explicitly requested while working in the current game follows the standing dual-sync rule above and does not require a second confirmation for that same current-game/template file update.
